# PyGMM

Python code for Guassian Mixture Models, using for video background modeling, based on the paper of Stauffer, C. and W. E. L. Grimson (1999).

# Dependency

1. Python 3.6.2
2. Python OpenCV 4.2.0

# Test Result

You can use surveillance videos to test the code.

# TODO

1. The speed is very slow and should make something up to speed it.
